    //             sContent: '<h3>INTRODUCTION: -</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>An epidemic of lower back pain affects millions of individuals globally. One significant cause of this pain stems from disc problems in the lumbar spine, such as disc herniations, degeneration, or nerve impingement. To accurately diagnose these disc issues, healthcare professionals rely on various physical assessments. Among the most reliable tests is the Slump Test.</p><h3>What is the Slump Test?</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>The Slump Test is a physical examination technique used to assess neural tension, particularly in the lumbar spine. It’s often employed by physiotherapists, chiropractors, and physicians to evaluate nerve root compression or disc pathologies. When someone has pain radiating from their lower back into the legs, known as sciatica, the Slump Test can provide valuable insights into whether a lumbar disc problem is the source of the pain.</p><p>Why is the Slump Test Important for Lumbar Spine Disc Diseases? Disc diseases in the lumbar spine, such as herniated or bulging discs, can compress the spinal nerves. This compression leads to a range of symptoms, including pain, numbness, and tingling sensations, particularly down the legs. The Slump Test helps in pinpointing the source of these symptoms, especially when they are related to nerve involvement due to disc displacement.</p><p>The test mimics a slouched posture, which stretches the spinal cord and nerve roots. If a disc problem exists, this stretch aggravates the pain or discomfort, confirming the involvement of lumbar disc issues.</p><h3>How is the Slump Test Performed?</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>The Slump Test is typically done in a clinical setting. Here’s how it works:<br /><ul><li><p>Patient Position: The patient sits on the edge of the examination table with their thighs supported, knees flexed, and feet dangling.</p></li><li><p>Posture Slumping: The patient is asked to slump or round their back while keeping their head upright. This posture places stress on the spinal structures.</p></li><li><p>Neck Flexion: The patient is then instructed to flex their neck by bringing the chin toward the chest.</p></li><li><p>Leg Extension: With the patient in this slumped position, one leg is slowly extended by the clinician, which stretches the sciatic nerve and the nerve roots in the lumbar spine.</p></li><li><p>Response Assessment: The patient is asked if they feel any reproduction of their symptoms, such as pain, numbness, or tingling down the leg. If so, it indicates the likelihood of lumbar nerve root irritation, often due to a disc herniation or other disc pathology.</p></li></ul></p><h3>Interpretation of Results:</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>Positive Test: If the patient experiences a reproduction of their typical symptoms, particularly sciatica-like pain, while performing the test, it’s considered a positive result. This strongly suggests neural involvement due to lumbar disc issues.</p><p>Negative Test: If the patient does not experience any symptoms or discomfort, the result is negative. This could indicate that the disc is not the cause of the pain, or that the symptoms are stemming from other sources like muscular tension or joint dysfunction.</p><h3>Clinical Relevance of the Slump Test:</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>The Slump Test is a useful tool in diagnosing lumbar disc problems because it reproduces the mechanical stresses that occur when the lumbar spine’s nerve roots are irritated. It provides valuable direction to clinicians in determining the next steps for treatment, including physiotherapy, chiropractic adjustments, or even more invasive interventions like injections or surgery.</p><h3>Limitations of the Slump Test:</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>Although the Slump Test is valuable, it’s not the only tool for diagnosing lumbar disc disease. It must be combined with other assessments such as:</p><p>MRI or CT scans to confirm disc herniations or degenerations. Range of motion tests to rule out joint-related issues. Reflex testing to evaluate the extent of nerve involvement. Additionally, the Slump Test is a subjective test based on the patient’s response, so it requires skilled interpretation from the clinician.</p><h3>Conclusion:</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>The Slump Test is a crucial direction-providing test in diagnosing disc diseases of the lumbar spine. It helps clinicians assess nerve root compression due to disc herniation or bulging, which is often the source of lower back pain radiating down the legs. As part of a comprehensive physical assessment, the Slump Test can offer clear guidance for treatment strategies, ultimately helping patients recover from lumbar spine issues and regain their quality of life.</p><p>For anyone experiencing lower back pain or sciatica-like symptoms, consult a healthcare provider to assess the possibility of disc-related problems using diagnostic tools like the Slump Test. Early detection can lead to more effective treatments and a quicker recovery.</p>'

According to research, elderly men&#39;s and women&#39;s immunological responses to influenza vaccine vary significantly.</p><p>Hormonal differences between men and women have a significant role in these discrepancies. Estrogen, which is found in greater amounts in women, has been demonstrated to improve immunological response to vaccinations, particularly flu injections. According to studies, women may have a stronger immunological response to vaccination than males because of hormonal influences.</p><p>Furthermore, age-related immune system changes, known as immunosenescence, influence how older people respond to immunizations. In general, older persons have a weakened immune system, which leads to a worse response to vaccination. However, research suggests that women may maintain greater immune function as they age than males, perhaps leading to a more effective response to flu vaccines.</p><p>In addition, variations in the way older men and women react to flu vaccines might be attributed to hereditary factors. It is known that individual reactions to vaccination are influenced by differences in genes linked to immune function and vaccine response. Variations in vaccination effectiveness between older men and women have been identified; these discrepancies may be partially explained by genetic differences.</p><p>In summary, whereas vaccinations against influenza protect against the disease for older men and women alike, there are notable variations in the immune responses of these populations. Comprehending these distinctions is crucial for refining vaccination plans for senior citizens and creating specialized methods to increase vaccination efficacy in this demographic.</p>'

Aerobic exercise improves cardiovascular and pulmonary outcomes; however, conventional standing or treadmill-based exercise may not be feasible for elderly or mobility-limited individuals. Chair-based aerobic exercise is a low-impact, safe, and accessible alternative, yet its effects on pulmonary function and functional capacity in individuals with T2DM are not well documented.</p><p><strong>Objective:</strong> To evaluate the effects of chair-based aerobic exercise on pulmonary function and functional capacity in individuals with T2DM.</p><p><strong>Methods:</strong> A study was conducted on 30 individuals with T2DM, aged 45–60 years, divided into an experimental group (n = 15) and a control group (n = 15) for four weeks. The experimental group participated in chair-based aerobic exercise, while the control group performed walking. Pulmonary function parameters, including forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and FEV1/FVC ratio, were assessed using spirometry. Functional capacity was evaluated using the six-minute walk test (6MWT). Outcomes were measured before and after intervention. Pre- and post-intervention values were analyzed using paired t-tests, with significance set at p < 0.05.</p><p><strong>Result:</strong> Among participants (53.3% males, 46.7% females), the experimental group showed significant improvements in FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio, and 6MWT distance following chair-based aerobic exercise (p < 0.001). The control group showed no significant pulmonary function improvement, but minimal significant 6MWT improvement (p < 0.001). Between-group comparison revealed greater improvements in pulmonary function and functional capacity in the experimental group (p < 0.001).</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Chair-based aerobic exercise is a safe, effective, and low-cost intervention improving pulmonary function and functional capacity in T2DM.

Results from different research, however, still vary, particularly when it comes to specific behavioural domains including cognitive performance, oppositional behaviour, and hyperactivity. Therefore, in order to encourage teens to establish balanced and healthy digital habits, a deeper understanding of the relationship between screen time duration and other behavioural effects is needed.</p><p><strong>Objective:</strong> The present study aimed to examine the association between daily screen time duration and behavioural problems among adolescents, focusing on oppositional behaviour, cognitive problems, hyperactivity, and ADHD index scores.</p><p><strong>Methodology:</strong> A cross-sectional observational study involved 280 adolescent aged 11 to 16. Participants were separated into two groups based on their daily screen usage: those who spent less than 90 minutes (<90 min) or those who spent more than 90 minutes (>90 min). Conner's Parent Rating Scale-Revised (S) was used to assess behavioural outcomes. The ADHD index, oppositional behaviour, cognitive difficulties, and hyperactivity domain scores were investigated.

Among the fact that approximately 20% of the population suffer from lateral ankle sprain and 73% of the athlete’s population experience chronic ankle sprain. Among them, 59% reported a history of previous ankle sprain. As the primary healthcare providers, physiotherapists should treat patients with MSK disorders, including LASs, using evidence-based practice (EBP). In the past few years, a few CPGs and Consensus Statements have been released to help with applying EBP in LAS management.</p><p><strong>Objective:</strong> This study aims to assess physiotherapists’ knowledge, attitude, and adherence to evidence-based practice in managing ankle sprains and improving patient care.</p><p><strong>Methodology:</strong> Cross-sectional correlation study based on an online survey structured in four sections. Section I contains participants' demographic data; Section II is divided into 3 subsections: subsection 1 consists of Knowledge, subsection 2 consists of Attitude, and subsection 3 consists of Adherence.</p><p><strong>Result:</strong>  We received a total of 251 responses, of which 250 respondents were included in the study. Normality was assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and the results indicated that the total scores for knowledge, Attitude, and Adherence were normally distributed (P<0.05) for all variables.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> This study found that knowledge significantly predicts both attitude and adherence to evidence- based ankle sprain management. Strong positive correlations were observed between knowledge and attitude as well as knowledge and adherence, with knowledge explaining 45.4 % and 41% of variance, respectively. These findings highlight the importance of enhancing clinical knowledge to improve both attitudes and adherence to best practices in musculoskeletal care.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Ankle sprain, Attitude toward Evidence based practice, Ankle sprain, Evidence-based knowledge, clinical practice beliefs, rehabilitation adherence.</p>",

A very strong positive correlation (r=0.8) was found between balance confidence and balance performance in middle-aged adults whereas a moderate to strong positive correlation (r=0.5) was found between balance confidence and balance performance in older adults.
